> Start Loop

> Create list of actions

> Pick action based on effective DPS
> Effective dps is a function which checks enemy element and if the action is special, i.e. has more value than damage

> If action creates buff on cast, recalculate damage

> Move action to action_queue

> Check if action created buff after cast, apply buff
> Check if action created debuff after cast, apply debuff

> Check how long the action takes

> Order actions by ticks in action_queue

> Check how many ticks occured in that time
> Check if ticks created reactions
> Update tick based on new enemy RES/DEF and if they melt/vape
> Update tick damage if the damage is non-snapshot
> Check if tick cause buff/debuff (on-it)
> Give team energy based on ticks
> Pass time between tick
> check if buff, debuffs, dots have run out
> remove them if they've run out

> Pass time

> Check if buffs, debuffs, dots have run out
> Remove them if they've run out
