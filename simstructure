> Check if action is instant or dot
> If action creates buff on cast, recalculate damage

> If dot, move action to dot_actions

> If instant
> Check if action created reaction
> Update enemy.element + update action damage

> Check if action created buff after cast, apply buff
> Check if action created debuff after cast, apply debuff

> Check how long the action takes

> Check how many dot ticks occured in that time
> Check if dots created reactions
> Update DoT damage based on new enemy RES/DEF and if they melt/vape

> Pass time
> Reduce CDs, increase energy

> Check if buffs, debuffs, dots have run out
> Remove them if they've run out
